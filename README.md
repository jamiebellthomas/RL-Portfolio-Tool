# Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management
This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning (RL) model designed for portfolio management. The model leverages Stable-Baselines3â€™s PPO and DDPG algorithms to optimise asset allocation within a dynamic, simulated market environment, seeking to maximise risk-adjusted returns.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt`

## Setup
Clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:jamiebellthomas/RL-Portfolio-Tool.git`

Enter directory:
`cd RL-Portfolio-Tool`

Install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage 

## Generate data files

First make sure you have sufficient permissions to run the collection generation script
`chmod a+wrx create_collections.sh`
`./create_collections.sh`
