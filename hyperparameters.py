# This will be a storage place for hyperparameters that can be used in the financial model calculations.
# All hyperparameters will be stored in a dictionary with the key being the name of the hyperparameter and the value being the value of the hyperparameter.
# This will allow for easy access to the hyperparameters in the financial model calculations.
# The dictionary will be stored in a pickle file so that it can be easily accessed by the financial model calculations.
