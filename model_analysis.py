"""
This is a new script that will be used to analyse models that have be trained on each of the 5 evaluation metrics I have talked about in the report.
The script will be used to load the model results from the Validation folder and then analyse the results to see how well the model has performed.
Over each metric, the model will be compared to the benchmark model in that metric to see how well the model has performed.
Metrics are:
1. ROI
2. Sharpe Ratio
3. Volatility
4. Portfolio Entropy
5. Weighted Mean Asset Percentile of Assets in Portfolio (harder to calculate)
